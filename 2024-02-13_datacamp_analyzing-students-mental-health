--- Explore and analyze the students data to see how the study reached its conclusions and gain a better understanding of it. Specifically, you'll explore and analyze how the length of stay (stay) impacts the mental health of the international students present in the study.
--- Return a table with nine observations and five columns summarizing data for the international students: stay, count_int, average_phq, average_scs, and average_as, in that order. The average columns should contain the average of the todep, tosc, and toas columns for each length of stay, rounded to two decimal places. The count_int column should be the number of international students for each length of stay. Sort the results by the length of stay in descending order.
