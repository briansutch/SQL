AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

--- My answer: 9,268
--- Correct answer: 9,681
--- Solution:
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6

SELECT *
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6

--- Solution:
SELECT count(distinct customers.acctnum), avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers 
ON FebSales.orderid  =customers.order_id
WHERE FebSales.Quantity > 2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
